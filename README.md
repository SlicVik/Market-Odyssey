# Market-Odyssey

This project is from my senior design class in Fall 2023. The file containing all of the python code is called main.py. We created a grocery shopping app that provides the user with directions catered to their desired items and preferences. This app was created in Python using the framework Kivy. The app uses multiple APIs and Google Firebase as a database. There is a link below to google slides that goes deeply into each part of the project. There is another link below of a demo video of the app. 

Code will not be fully operational as the API keys were monthly trials that need monthly refreshers. This app is more of a proof of concept.
